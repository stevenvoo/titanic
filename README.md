# titanic

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2224 passengers and crew abroad the ship, and more than 1500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history.

In this project, I want to analyse the titanic data and apply the tools of machine learning to predict who would survive the tragedy. I will run the analysis using R.

The raw data and other more detailed descriptions are sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).
